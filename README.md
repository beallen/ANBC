# Alberta Native Bee Council Status of Bees (2018)

## Overview 

The Alberta Native Bee Council (ANBC) has implemented a province-wide sampling program for wild bees. This program samples native bees in 2018 using passive sampling techniques that can help inform the status and distribution of this group. Depending on the quality/quantity of the species data, we plan to address the following objectives:

- Create range maps for all species.
- Describe the relative abundance of each species.
- Assess the landscape-level impacts on native bee populations using species distribution models and/or use availability models.
- Identify how communities of bee species are distributed across the province.

To accomplish this, the ANBC is collaborating with the Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute to analyse the more than 10,000 unique specimens that were collected for this project.

This repository contains all code related to the analysis of the species data and creation of the GitHub page.

## Acknowledgements

We would like to acknowledge that this work would not be possible without all of the volunteers who helped organize, collect, identify, and analyze the samples collected as part of the 2018 survey. In addition, we would like to acknowledge the University of Calgary Digital Collections for providing images of Alberta's native bees and Alberta Environment and Protected Areas for providing their field surveys also conducted in 2018.
