<h2>Mining Bees</h2>

The andrenid bees (commonly known as mining bees) is a very large family of solitary, ground-nesting bees. Many are dark, black, and rather non-descript bees; others have bright red colors. Typically small to moderate-sized bees, they are somewhat dorsoventrally flattened and have an oval rather than parallel-sided abdomen. They have scopae on their legs and are commonly oligolectic. Andrenids are among the earliest bees to emerge in the spring, frequently seen visiting Salix (willows). Many of them are active only during this brief period, remaining underground through summer, fall and winter. In our 2018 survey,  we detected two species in the Andrenidae family.

<h2>Andrena</h2>

Andrena species are small to medium-sized (9 - 17 mm), lightly fuzzed bees ranging in colour from gray and brown to bright red. Males are smaller and more slender than females.  Andrena bees can be distinguished from most other small bees by the broad velvety areas in between the compound eyes and the antennal bases, called facial foveae. They also tend to have very long scopal hairs on the hind leg. 

 Andrena bees are often the first bees to fly in the spring, reaching their peak abundance in the spring with a few species emerging in the fall and a very few species out in mid-summer. They spend the winter in the underground cells as prepupae, emerging as adults when the ground begins to warm. They mate, then the females seek sites for their nest burrows where they construct small cells. They provision the cells with a ball of pollen mixed with nectar, where they lay an egg then seal the cell. Andrena usually prefer sandy soils for a nesting substrate, near or under shrubs. They are solitary bees, but may nest in aggregations.
