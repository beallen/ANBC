<center> <h2>Introduction</h2> </center>

<center>  This is very large family of solitary, ground-nesting bees. Many are dark, black, and rather nondescript bees; others have bright red colors. Mining bees are among the earliest bees to emerge in the spring, frequently seen visiting Salix (willows). Many of them are active only during this brief period, remaining underground through summer, fall and winter.  </center>

&nbsp;

<center>  In our 2018 survey, we detected two species (genus <b>Adrena</b>) in the Andrenidae family. These species were rare in our survey data and were detected at only 2 of 72 survey locations. </center>

<center>  <h2>Andrena</h2> </center>

<center>  Species in the <b>Adrena</b> genus are generally small to medium-sized (9 -17 mm), with males being smaller and more slender than females. They are lightly fuzzed bees ranging in colour from gray and brown to bright red. <b>Adrena</b> bees can be distinguished from most other small bees by the broad velvety areas in between the compound eyes and the antennal bases, called facial foveae. </center>

&nbsp;

<center> <b>Adrena</b> bees are often the first bees to fly in the spring, reaching their peak abundance in the spring with a few species emerging in the fall and a very few species out in mid-summer. They spend the winter in the underground cells as prepupae, emerging as adults when the ground begins to warm. </center>

&nbsp;

<center> Species in this genus are solitary bees, but may nest in aggregations. After mating, females seek sites for their nest burrows where they construct small cells. They provision the cells with a ball of pollen mixed with nectar, where they lay an egg then seal the cell. <b>Adrena</b> usually prefer sandy soils for a nesting substrate, near or under shrubs.   </center>
