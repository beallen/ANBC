<h2>Apidae</h2>

Members of the Apidae family are highly variable, but they tend to be large, hairy, fast-flying and have long tongues. Many of the females have dense scopal hairs that make the bee look like it’s wearing chaps or a polished area on their hind legs called a corbiculae where they pack pollen mixed with nectar in a basket formed by a rim of hairs.

<h2>Anthophora (Digger bees)</h2>

﻿Anthophora are medium to large (up to 3 cm long), robust and hairy bees that resemble bumble bees. They have scopal hairs on hind legs which they use to they carry dry pollen, unlike bumble bees which create moist masses of pollen which they pack into pollen baskets. Many have extremely long tongues.

Anthophora are solitary nesters, although they may be found in large aggregations. Most nest in the soil and larva develop in cells with waterproof linings produced by a Dufour’s gland. Some, including A. occidentalis and A. peritomae nest in cutbanks or chinking in old log cabins and under decks. A. peritomae nests in tightly packed sand and sandstone. They overwinter as mature larvae or adults.

<h2>Bombus (Bumble bees)</h2>

The most recognizable members of Alberta’s native bees are bumble bees. They are large, densely hairy bees in a variety of colour combinations of yellow, black and sometimes orange. They are the largest bees in Alberta, with the Nevada bumble bee (Bombus nevadensis) measuring up to 25 mm in length. Except for the cuckoo bumble bees (sometimes classified in a subgenera, Psithyrus) and males, bumble bees possess a corbiculae on the hind leg, which is a broadening of the tibia leaving a polished surface surrounded by bristles that create a basket for a gummy mix of pollen and nectar.

Like all bees, an adult bumble bee emerges from the pupa fully grown. Queens are larger than males and most of the queen’s daughters. The size of the bee is related to which species it is, as well as how well fed it was during its larval stage. Later in the summer when there are fewer flowering plants, offspring may be much smaller than the bees produced earlier in the season when more food is available. 

Bumble bees are described as eusocial because the queen is assisted by her daughters in raising other young bees. The queen mates with a male in the fall, then overwinters as a fertilized queen until she emerges in the early spring. She will then search a location for her nest, which is usually underground but may be in an abandoned mouse nest, inside a building wall or in a bird house. 

During the first phase of the colony, the queen gathers nectar and pollen to provision her nest. She moulds the pollen into a lump on which she lays her eggs. She continues to forage to feed this first generation of sterile female workers until they mature and can begin to supply the nest with pollen and nectar. After this generation matures, the queen remains in the nest to lay more eggs, some of which become new queens or males. Typically, a bumble bee nest will have fewer than 200 individuals (compared to about 60,000 in a honey bee hive).  Near the end of the summer the queen lays some male eggs in addition to female ones. The females born at this time become queens, not sterile workers, and they mate soon after they emerge in the late summer fall as adults.  The males die after mating and the fertilized queens overwinter to emerge in the spring to establish a new nest. All the workers and drones and the old queen die at the end of summer; the only survivors are the new queens, already mated. They find a secluded and safe place to overwinter, emerging in the spring to start a new colony.

Bumble bees are tough. They are more tolerant of the cold than most adult insects so they are some of the first bees seen in the spring and are the last bees flying in the fall. They are robust fliers and can forage in windy conditions that have other insects huddling in grass.

Bumble bees forage on a wide variety of flowering plants.  Tongue lengths vary from one species to another, which results in preferences for particular types of flowers. Bees with long tongues tend to collect pollen and nectar from tubular flowers, such as Astragalus (milk-vetch), Penstemon (beardtongue), Delphinium (larkspur) and Oxytropis (locoweed). Bumble bees with short tongues generally prefer shallow flowers such as Epilobium (fireweed), Helianthus (sunflower), Potentilla (cinquefoil), Solidago (goldenrod), Ribes (currant) and Fragaria (strawberry).
