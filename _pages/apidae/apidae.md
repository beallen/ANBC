<center> <h2>Introduction</h2> </center>

<center> Members of the <b>Apidae</b> family are highly variable, but they tend to be large, hairy, fast-flying and have long tongues. Many of the females have dense scopal hairs that make the bee look like it’s wearing chaps or a polished area on their hind legs called a corbiculae where they pack pollen mixed with nectar in a basket formed by a rim of hairs. </center>

&nbsp;

<center> In our 2018 survey, this was the most common family identified. Within the ANBC surveys, there were 37 unique species identified which were detected at 69 out of 72 locations. </center>

<center> <h2>Anthophora (Digger Bees)</h2> </center>

<center> <b>Anthophora</b> are medium to large (up to 3 cm long), robust and hairy bees that resemble bumble bees. They have scopal hairs on hind legs which they use to they carry dry pollen, unlike bumble bees which create moist masses of pollen which they pack into pollen baskets. Many have extremely long tongues. </center>

&nbsp;

<center> Species in this genus are solitary nesters, although they may be found in large aggregations. Most nest in the soil and larva develop in cells with waterproof linings produced by a Dufour’s gland. However, some species will nest in cutbanks, chinking in old log cabins, under decks, or in tightly packed sand and sandstone. </center>

<center> <h2>Bombus (Bumble Bees)</h2> </center>

<center> The most recognizable members of Alberta’s native bees are Bumble Bees. They are large, densely hairy bees in a variety of colour combinations of yellow, black and sometimes orange. They are the largest bees in Alberta, with the Nevada bumble bee (<i>Bombus nevadensis</i>) measuring up to 25 mm in length. </center>

&nbsp;

<center> Bumble bees are described as eusocial because the queen is assisted by her daughters in raising other young bees. The queen mates with a male in the fall, then overwinters as a fertilized queen until she emerges in the early spring. She will then search a location for her nest, which is usually underground but may be in an abandoned mouse nest, inside a building wall or in a bird house. </center>
