<center> <h2>Introduction</h2> </center> 

<center> Some of the prettiest bees in Alberta belong to the <b>Halictidae</b> family. Many are metallic green; others are blue or copper and some are black.  They are commonly referred to as "sweat bees" (especially the smaller species), as they are often attracted to perspiration. </center> 

&nbsp;

<center> Most species in this group nest in the ground. Some are completely solitary but others share the entrance to their nests. They lay their eggs in cells lined with waterproof material produced in the Dufour’s gland, and provision their young with a mixture of pollen and nectar. </center> 

&nbsp;

<center> In our 2018 survey, we detected twelve species in this family. These species were moderately common in our survey data and were detected at 34 of 72 survey locations. </center> 

<center> <h2>Agapostemon</h2> </center> 

<center> <b>Agaposteman</b> are medium-sized (9 – 11 mm), brilliant green or blue-green bees, with yellow- and black-banded abdomens in the males. They nest deeply in hard soil, and some species in this genus  will form dense aggregations where multiple females share the same nest entrance. </center> 

<center> <h2>Dufourea</h2> </center> 

<center> <b>Dufourea</b> are generally nondescript, small dark bees. They are solitary bees which line their nest cells with nectar that is tamped into the soil which provides some protection to the larva. Although they may acquire nectar at a wide variety of floral hosts, they are generally quite restrictive in the plants from which they collect pollen. </center> 

<center> <h2>Halictus</h2> </center> 

<center> <b>Halictus</b> are small (7 – 11 mm), brown to black bees, sometimes greenish, with white stripes across the abdomen. Their common name (sweat bees) is due to their habit of sometimes siping sweat from humans. Many species in this genus are eusocial. </center> 

&nbsp;

<center> A female will overwinter as a fertilized “foundress”. She will emerge in the spring and dig a nest in the soil which she will line with a waterproof material. She will lay a few eggs which will become female workers which will gather nectar and pollen and care for the next round of bee larvae. At the end of the season, some of the eggs will become males. </center> 

<center> <h2>Lasioglossum </h2> </center> 

<center> <b>Lasioglossum bees</b> are small (6 – 9 mm), usually black, mostly shiny and bald, sometimes with white bands on their abdomen. Though some species will have a metallic sheen. Almost all are soil-nesting bees with a range of lifestyles, ranging from solitary, sometimes nesting in aggregations, to eusocial. These bees are polylectic and are found throughout the flowering season. </center>
