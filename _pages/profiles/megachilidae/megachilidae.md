<center> <h2>Introduction</h2> </center> 

<center> Bees in the Megachilidae family build their nest cells from soil (mason bees) or leaves (leaf cutter bees). A few collect plant or animal hairs and fibres to construct nest cells and are called carder bees. Most species nest in holes in wood or hollow twigs, but there are also a few that nest in the ground. Members of this family (except the cuckoo bees) are recognizable because they carry pollen on their hairy underbelly. </center> 

&nbsp;

<center> In our 2018 survey, we detected eighteen species in this family. These species were moderately common in our survey data and were detected at 26 of 72 survey locations. </center> 

<center> <h2>Anthidium and Dianthidium (Carder bees)</h2> </center> 

<center> <b>Anthidium</b> are moderate to large, black and yellow bees with scopa located on the underside of their abdomens. Females shave the fuzz off plant leaves with their mandibles and take it back to their nests where they use it to line nest cells; males are larger than females and guard their territories from intruders. </center> 

&nbsp;

<center> <b>Dianthidium</b> are small (7 mm), stocky black bees with yellow spots, and easily mistaken for wasps. These species will collect pollen and nectar as well as resin which they use in nest building. They nest in riverbanks, sometimes in nesting aggregations, and holes in wood in plant stems. They use pebbles or grains of sand held together by plant resins for nesting material, and they may be located on twigs, or on roots below the soil surface, or in any available burrows or borings. </center> 

<center> <h2>Hoplitis (Summer Mason Bees)</h2> </center> 

<center> <b>Hoplitis</b> bees are small to medium-sized bees. They have a long, cylindrical abdomen and thorax. They are generally non-metallic black, apart from a few common North American species which can be vibrantly metallic green. They have a variety of nesting habits, ranging from nesting in excavated burrows in soil, cracks in rocks, or pithy plant stems to pre-existing abandoned beetle, wasp, and bee burrows, empty galls, and empty snail shells. They will use materials such as leaf pulp, pebbles, masticated leaves, bits of wood, resin, clay, sand, and petals to create partitions between cells and nest plugs.</center> 

<center> <h2>Megachile (Leaf Cutter Bees)</h2> </center> 

<center> <b>Megachile</b> are the archetypal leafcutter bee. They are moderately large (12 â€“ 18 mm) and are usually grey to matte black (never metallic). Females have prominent scopa on underside of abdomen and males may have long manes of hair on their front legs. They often have bumps, horns and hooks on stocky, black bodies. These species will use enormous mandibles which they use to snip pieces of leaves or petals from plants to use them in nest building. </center>  

&nbsp;

<center> Many species nest in the soil, sometimes gregariously, while others make their tunnels in rotting wood, or use borings or cavities in wood or in plant stems. Nests are typically composed of single long columns of cells. The female places an egg in each cell with a supply of pollen, sometimes mixed with nectar.The larva hatches from the egg and consumes the food supply. </center>
