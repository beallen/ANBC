<center> <h1>Species Richness</h1> </center>

<center> Though there are multiple ways to measure biodiversity, species richness is the most common indicator used by conservationist and land managers. The more species supported by a landscape, the greater the stability of the ecosystem. Though not all habitats can support a large number of species, understanding how species richness has declined across habitats can provide an insight on current ecosystem stability. </center>

<center> Within the surveys that included information about the entire bee community, we found that species richness was highest in open grass/shrub and upland forest habitats. </center>

<center> When focusing on the impacts of human footprint, bee richness was predicted to be high in harvested areas and pasture, while low in crop and urban/industrial features. </center>

<center> Based on these relationships, we can make predictions about the impact of land-use change on native bee richness. We do this by comparing the predicted richness based on the current landscape (2018) to a reference state where footprint has been replaced with native habitat. We found that bee richness has declined throughout the grassland natural region due to large amounts of cultivation and urban industrial features. </center>

<center> We do predict an increase in bee richness in areas with forestry related activities. However, we are working to understand the ecological mechanisms behind these results. </center>
