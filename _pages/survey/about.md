<center>  <h2>About</h2> </center>

<center> Pollinators are a crucial component of terrestrial ecosystems because of the pollination services they provide. Globally, pollinators are under threat from a number of factors including, habitat loss, pesticide use, novel diseases, and climate change. However, our understanding of pollinators in Alberta is lacking. Canada’s boreal forest (Alberta’s primary habitat) in general has been under-sampled for important pollinator taxa, like bees. The federal government lists 321 wild bee species as occurring in Alberta. However, only 75% of these have sufficient data to be assigned a conservation status ranking, and 34% of these are of conservation concern. </center>

&nbsp;

<center> These data deficiencies can be remedied by systematic sampling of different portions of the province on different years, as done by the Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute, but bees are not formally monitored by this organization. Alternatively, one can acquire a broad single-season snapshot of bee populations by sampling simultaneously across a geographic range. A survey like this, covering such a large geographic scale, requires a coordinated and cooperative effort. Alberta Agriculture and Forestry, as well as other citizen scientists throughout Alberta, are providing the much-needed assistance so that the Alberta Native Bee Council can conduct a province-wide survey in 2018. </center>

&nbsp;

<center> Since our survey in 2018, there has been a proliferation of publicly available data on native bees in Alberta. This data has been collected through organizations such as the Alberta Conservation Association, Strickland Entomological Museum, Alberta Environment and Protected Areas, and citizen science initiatives (iNaturalist). We felt it was important to compile this information to better assess the distribution of native bees. </center>

<center>  <h2>Locations</h2> </center>

<center>  The Alberta Native Bee Council utilized a large volunteer base to deploy and recollected blue vane traps across Alberta. In total, we were able to survey 72 locations. In addition, we were able to incorporate four additional data sources where surveys were conducted between 2011 and 2022: </center> 

&nbsp;

<center>  1) Surveys collected in 2018 by Alberta Environment and Protected Areas. </center> 
<center>  2) Surveys collected in 2019 by the Alberta Conservation Association. </center> 
<center>  3) Research-grade observations from iNaturalist. </center> 
<center>  4) Observations stored in the Strickland Entomological Museum. </center>

</a>

<center> At each of these location, we summarized the surrounding native landcover and human footprint within an 800m buffer. The amount of human footprint within the buffer was calculated for the year that surveys were conducted. </center>

<center>  <h3>Alberta Native Bee Council</h3>  </center>

<center> The majority of surveys were conducted in upland forested habitats including Deciduous, Pine, and Spruce stands. The largest footprint types wtihin these surveys were forestry harvest areas, followed by urban industrial and soft linear (e.g., road verges) features. </center>

</a>

<center>  <h3>Alberta Environment and Protected Areas</h3>  </center>

<center> Survey effort was primarily focused on agriculture features such as crops and pastures. Native habitats were surveyed less, with grass/shrub and deciduous stands being the dominant habitats. </center>

<center>  <h3>Alberta Conservation Association</h3>  </center>

<center> Sites for this project were designed to assess differences between pastures and native habitats. The amount of survey effort reflects that with pastures making up approximately half the survey effort, with native habitats composing most the remaining amount. </center>

<center>  <h3>iNaturalist</h3>  </center>

<center> As iNaturalist surveys are conducted based on citizen science initiatives, we see a large bias towards urban industrial, soft linear (e.g., road verges), and hard linear (e.g., road and rails) features. </center>

<center>  <h3>Strickland Entomological Museum</h3>  </center>

<center> The samples collected the the Strickland Entomological Museum also exhibit bias towards sampling various human footprint features compared to native habitats. </center>
