<center>  <h3>Alberta Native Bee Council</h3>  </center>

<center> The majority of surveys were conducted in upland forested habitats including Deciduous, Pine, and Spruce stands. The largest footprint types wtihin these surveys were forestry harvest areas, followed by urban industrial and soft linear (e.g., road verges) features. Data will be made publicly available upon completion of processing the specimens.</center>

<center>  <h3>Alberta Environment and Protected Areas</h3>  </center>

<center> Survey effort was primarily focused on agriculture features such as crops and pastures. Native habitats were surveyed less, with grass/shrub and deciduous stands being the dominant habitats. </center>

<center>  <h3>Alberta Conservation Association</h3>  </center>

<center> Sites for this project were designed to assess differences between pastures and native habitats. The amount of survey effort reflects that with pastures making up approximately half the survey effort, with native habitats composing most the remaining amount. </center>

<center>  <h3>iNaturalist</h3>  </center>

<center> As iNaturalist surveys are conducted based on citizen science initiatives, we see a large bias towards urban industrial, soft linear (e.g., road verges), and hard linear (e.g., road and rails) features. </center>

<center>  <h3>Strickland Entomological Museum</h3>  </center>

<center> The samples collected the the Strickland Entomological Museum also exhibit bias towards sampling various human footprint features compared to native habitats. </center>
