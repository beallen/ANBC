Pollinators are a crucial component of terrestrial ecosystems because of the pollination services they provide. Globally, pollinators are under threat from a number of factors including, habitat loss, pesticide use, novel diseases, and climate change. Our research is focused on establishing a baseline of wild bee populations and assessing their relations with weather to help assess potential climate change impacts on those populations. 

Our understanding of wild bees in Alberta is lacking. Indeed, Canada’s boreal forest (Alberta’s primary habitat) in general has been under-sampled for important pollinator taxa, like bees. The federal government lists 321 wild bee species as occurring in Alberta. However, only 75% of these have sufficient data to be assigned a conservation status ranking, and 34% of these are of conservation concern. These data deficiencies can be remedied by systematic sampling of different portions of the province on different years, as done by the Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute, but bees are not formally monitored by this organization. Alternatively, one can acquire a broad single-season snapshot of bee populations by sampling simultaneously across a geographic range. A survey like this, covering such a large geographic scale, requires a coordinated and cooperative effort.  Alberta Agriculture and Forestry, as well as other citizen scientists throughout Alberta, are providing the much-needed assistance so that the Alberta Native Bee Council can conduct a province-wide survey in 2018.
