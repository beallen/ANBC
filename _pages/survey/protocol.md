# Field Surveys

Surveys were conducted throughout the spring and summer of 2018 across Alberta. In general, blue vane traps were deployed for a period of approximately two weeks. Specimens were then emptied from the trap and stored in glycol until species identification could be completed. The traps were then stored for two weeks, before they were redeployed for another two week survey.
