<center>  <h2>Locations</h2> </center>

<center>  The Alberta Native Bee Council utilized a large volunteer base to deploy and recollected blue vane traps across Alberta. In total, we were able to survey 72 locations. In addition, we were able to incorporate four additional data sources where surveys were conducted between 2011 and 2022: </center> 

&nbsp;

<center>  1) Surveys collected in 2018 by Alberta Environment and Protected Areas. </center> 
<center>  2) Surveys collected in 2019 by the Alberta Conservation Association. </center> 
<center>  3) Research-grade observations from iNaturalist. </center> 
<center>  4) Observations stored in the Strickland Entomological Museum. </center>

</a>

<center> At each of these location, we summarized the surrounding native landcover and human footprint within an 800m buffer. The amount of human footprint within the buffer was calculated for the year that surveys were conducted. </center>

<center>  <h3>Alberta Native Bee Council</h3>  </center>

<center> The majority of surveys were conducted in upland forested habitats including Deciduous, Pine, and Spruce stands. The largest footprint types wtihin these surveys were forestry harvest areas, followed by urban industrial and soft linear (e.g., road verges) features. </center>

</a>

<center>  <h3>Alberta Environment and Protected Areas</h3>  </center>

<center> Survey effort was primarily focused on agriculture features such as crops and pastures. Native habitats were surveyed less, with grass/shrub and deciduous stands being the dominant habitats. </center>

<center>  <h3>Alberta Conservation Association</h3>  </center>

<center> Sites for this project were designed to assess differences between pastures and native habitats. The amount of survey effort reflects that with pastures making up approximately half the survey effort, with native habitats composing most the remaining amount. </center>

<center>  <h3>iNaturalist</h3>  </center>

<center> As iNaturalist surveys are conducted based on citizen science initiatives, we see a large bias towards urban industrial, soft linear (e.g., road verges), and hard linear (e.g., road and rails) features. </center>

<center>  <h3>Strickland Entomological Museum</h3>  </center>

<center> The samples collected the the Strickland Entomological Museum also exhibit bias towards sampling various human footprint features compared to native habitats. </center>
