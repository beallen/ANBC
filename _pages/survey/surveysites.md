<h2>Locations</h2>

The Alberta Native Bee Council (ANBC) utilized a large volunteer base to deploy and recollected blue vane traps across Alberta. In total, we were able to survey 72 locations. In addition, we were able to incorporate surveys from Alberta Environment and Protected Areas (EPA) at 43 that were also surveyed in 2018.

<h2>Habitat</h2>

At each of these location, we summarized the surrounding landcover within an 800m buffer. The majority of the sites that were surveyed by both the ANBC and EPA were surrounded by native deciduous, pine, spruce, grass/shurb habitats. In addition, lowland habitats types including treed bogs and fens, swamps, and other wetland habitats (e.g., gaminoid fen, marsh) were not sampled in 2018. Many sites were surrounded by multiple types of human footprint include crops, urban industrial, forestry and pastures. Human footprint types such as soft linear (e.g., seismic lines, road verges, pipelines,etc) and hard linear (road and rail lines) were not well sampled by the survey.
