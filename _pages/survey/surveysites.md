<h2>Locations</h2>

The Alberta Native Bee Council utilized a large volunteer base to deploy and recollected blue vane traps across Alberta. In total, we were able to survey 72 locations. In addition, we were able to incorporate surveys from Alberta Environment and Protected Areas at 43 that were also surveyed in 2018.

At each of these location, we summarized the surrounding landcover within an 800m buffer.
