<h1>2018 Monitoring Program</h1>

The Alberta Native Bee Council (ANBC) has implemented a province-wide sampling program for wild bees. This program samples native bees in 2018 using passive sampling techniques (blue vane traps) that can help inform the status and distribution of this group. Depending on the quality/quantity of the species data, we plan to address the following objectives:

<ol>
  <li>Create range maps for all species.</li>
  <li>Describe the relative abundance of each species.</li>
  <li>Assess the landscape-level impacts on native bee populations using species distribution models and/or use availability models.</li>
  <li>Identify how communities of bee species are distributed across the province.</li>
</ol>

The ANBC is collaborating with the Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute (ABMI) to analyze the ~10,000 unique species collected by the ANBC.
