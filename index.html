  <li>Currently, they are under threat from a number of factors including, habitat loss, pesticide use, novel diseases, and climate change.</li>

  <li>In 2018, the Alberta Native Bee Council organized a group of volunteers across Alberta to sample Alberta's native bee populations.</li>
  <li>Since our survey, there has been a proliferation of publicly available data on native bees in Alberta.</li>
  <li>We compiled data from organiziations including: Alberta Conservation Association, Stickland Entomological Museum, Alberta Environment and Protected Areas, and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. </li>
  <li>Explore the Bee Atlas to see where species were detected, their specific habitat associations, and which areas of Alberta are rich in bee biodiversity. </li>
