<h1>2018 Monitoring Program</h1>

In 2018, the Alberta Native Bee Council was able to organize a set of volunteers across Alberta to sample Alberta's native bee populations. The goal of this survey was to identify the current status and distribution of bees. A high level overview of our protocol, sampling locations, and results can be found in the <b>2018 Survey</b> section. For more detailed information about individual species identified in our survey, click on one of the five taxonomic families. 

The contents of this data are still under analysis and are subject to change.
